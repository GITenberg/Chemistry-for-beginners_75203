<p>The ancient Greeks, when they looked about
them on the world in which they lived, came
to the definite conclusion that everything is in
a constant state of flux, or change. Things
animate and inanimate gradually disintegrated
and tended either to disappear (apparently) or
to change into other forms of matter. With
their true æsthetic sense, they felt it necessary
that there should be some <em>one</em> permanent thing
in the world, underlying all the changes which
they saw going on about them, and many of
their early speculations were devoted to the
nature and constitution of this one “permanent
thing.” Thales, of Myletus, who flourished
about 585 B.&nbsp;C., and who was, perhaps, the
first great philosopher and physicist, contended
that the essential principle of things,—the substance,
or stuff, of all things,—must be <em>water</em>.
He held the view that, by condensation and
rarefaction of water all things rise, and he
actually attempted an evolutionary account of
the Genesis of Man, Plants and Animals, with
this idea as a basis for his thought.</p>

<p>Anaximenes said that <em>air</em>, or <em>ether</em>, must be
the substance of things. Heraclitus regarded
<em>fire</em> as the most primary element in the universe,—from
which all else arises. Anaximander
said that the “unlimited”—a sort of boundless,
animated mass—is the ultimate substance.
Plato, as we know, contended that the permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
reality of things was not anything material
at all, but was mind, or <em>spirit</em>. Empedocles,
(495–435 B.&nbsp;C.) advanced the theory that
there are four elements—Earth, Air, Fire and
Water. Anaxagoras contended that nothing
changed of itself, but that it is caused or made
to change, and that <em>that</em> which produces these
changes is the permanent reality. This he believed
to be a sort of mind or universal intelligence
(<i>Nous</i>), but he regarded this mind as
strictly impersonal, as well as immaterial, and
did not attempt to answer the difficulty as to
how mind can affect matter in any detailed
manner.</p>

<p>It was only natural that, prior to the discovery
of the laws of the indestructibility of
matter and energy, that this sense of “change”
should have struck these early thinkers very
forcibly, since they had no means of ascertaining
that, when matter disappears from our
sight, it is not actually destroyed. We now
know that, when we burn a candle, the candle
disappears, but that the elements composing
the candle are merely changed into invisible
gaseous compounds, which are no longer visible
to the human eye. Lacking delicate instruments
of precision, the ancients could not know
this; to them, the matter of the candle would
have disappeared. Hence, it was only natural
that they should seek the ultimate reality behind
these changes, and speculate as to its
origin and nature.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ALCHEMY"><span id="toclink_7"></span>ALCHEMY</h2>
</div>

<p>The modern science of chemistry is relatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
new. It gradually emerged from alchemy,
which practically constituted the chemistry
of the middle ages. The objects of alchemy
were various: (1) the transmutation
of the base metals into gold, by means of the
so-called “Philosopher’s Stone”; (2) The fixation
of Mercury; (3) The discovery of the
elixir of Life, etc. These were the purely
chemical aspects of alchemy, but we now know
that the alchemists had much more than this
in mind, in their experimental work, and that
they hinted at their true meaning in many of
their veiled writings. Many of the higher types
of alchemists were also mystics, and when they
wrote in chemical symbols, they really concealed
their inner meaning; they referred, very
largely, to the inner spirit of man, and the
methods by which this could be changed or
transformed into some higher spiritual being.
(See “Alchemy Ancient and Modern,” by H.
Stanley Redgrove; “Alchemy, Its Scope and
Romance,” by the Rev. J.&nbsp;E. Mercer, etc.) Mr.
Foster Damon has lately published a series of
articles in which he has brought forward a
mass of evidence tending to prove that the alchemists
were also deep students of psychic
phenomena, and that their experiments relative
to the “First Matter” were really experiments
in so-called “Materialization!” He has
published his findings in a series of articles in
the “Occult Review.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="MODERN_CHEMISTRY"><span id="toclink_8"></span>MODERN CHEMISTRY</h2>
</div>

<p>Modern chemistry may be said to begin with
Robert Boyle (1626–1691). He defined an element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
as a substance which could not be decomposed,
but which could enter into combination
with other elements, giving compounds
capable of decomposition into these original
elements. The number of elements which were
thought to exist varied greatly,—some contending
that they were but few in number, others
that they were numerous. It must be remembered
that all this was before the time of Dalton,
and that the atomic theory had not yet
been advanced as a scientific hypothesis, since
the days of the ancient Greeks, when Democritus
and Epicurus had defended this view.
The swing of science, at that time was, therefore,
toward the materialism of those older
writers, and the atomic theories which they
had then proposed.</p>

<p>Chemistry is that branch of science which investigates
the nature and properties of matter
in all its forms. It is, perhaps, the most materialistic
of all the sciences, since it deals essentially
with matter. Physics deals with forces
or energies, or the energies manifested by and
through matter, but the two are more or less
inter-related—especially of late years, as we
shall see. Chemistry is essentially an <em>experimental</em>
science, and practically everything
which has been learned about it has been acquired
by means of laboratory experimentation.
But here as elsewhere theories have woven together
the mass of separate facts, and of them
made a consistent and philosophical science.</p>

<p>There are two main divisions of chemistry—inorganic
and organic; that is to say, the chemistry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of “dead” matter, and the chemistry of
“living” or organic substances. Chemical experiments
may be for the purpose of <em>analysis</em>—discovering
the constituents of a given substance;
<em>synthesis</em>, in which a compound substance
is “created” from several simpler ones;
or purely <em>experimental</em>, in which certain tests
are made, and the results or reäctions noted.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="MEDIAEVAL_CHEMISTRY"><span id="toclink_10"></span>MEDIAEVAL CHEMISTRY</h2>
</div>

<p>As before stated, Chemistry is more or less
the direct child of Alchemy; but before the
modern, scientific period of chemical research
had been reached, two transitional stages were
first of all passed through. These were (1)
The so-called “Iatro-Chemical” period—the
period of medical mysticism; and (2) the
“phlogistic” period. A few words will be necessary
to explain each of these terms, and the
period of chemical development which they
covered.</p>

<p>As may be inferred from the name, the iatro-chemical
period was one in which attempts
were made to combine chemistry and medicine,
and make the former serve the latter. All
kinds of weird concoctions were tried, and attempts
were made to explain, on chemical principles,
all the changes and reactions occurring
in the body—an attempt which was necessarily
futile for the chemistry of that day. However,
many important results were achieved, as the
consequence of experimentation, and chemical
science was on the whole enriched, even though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the workers of that day were inspired by totally
erroneous views.</p>

<p>The Phlogistic Period takes its name from
a hypothetical substance denominated “phlogiston.”
This was supposed to be an invisible
principle or entity, constituting the basis of
Fire, and corresponds to the “pure fire” of Zoroaster.
The Phlogiston theory was propounded
and championed by Stahl, and it was defined
by him as follows:</p>

<p>“Phlogiston is ... a very subtle matter,
capable of penetrating the most dense substances;
it neither burns, nor glows, nor is
visible; it is agitated by an igneous motion,
and it is capable of communicating its motion
to material particles apt to receive it. The particles
when indued with this rapid motion constitute
visible fire....”</p>

<p>This conception dominated the whole scientific
world for many years. The experimental
work undertaken by Scheele and Priestly, however,
finally enabled Lavoisier to discover the
true nature of “fire”—combustion. In a famous
“Memoir,” published in 1783, entitled “Reflections
Concerning Phlogiston,” he showed that
all the observed phenomena could be accounted
for without the presence of any hypothetical
phlogiston; in fact, as he himself says, they
“can be better explained without phlogiston
than by means of it.” His discovery of oxygen,
in the atmosphere, was a fundamentally important
step in modern chemical science.
Hitherto, the air was thought to be a single
gas, or a mixture of various gases; but oxygen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
was unknown as its most important constituent.
Lavoisier’s discovery finally disposed of the
phlogiston idea, and ushered in the new era of
scientific chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be thought that undue space has been
devoted to this theory of Phlogiston; but anyone
reading the history of Chemistry will realize
the extent to which this idea completely
dominated the minds of men at that time,
and how all chemical researches were perverted
by it. The discovery of the true nature
of combustion was one of the fundamental
turning-points in the history of scientific
thought.</p>

<p>The material world in which we live is very
evidently composed of a variety of substances.
At least some of these were soon seen to exist
in at least three different states—solid, liquid
and gaseous. These seemed to differ radically
from one another; ice, water and steam are
as different as one can imagine; and yet, somehow,
they were the same thing after all; for
ice melts and becomes water, and water, when
heated, becomes steam. On the contrary, steam
cools and becomes water again, and when it
is sufficiently cold, will again form ice. There
must be some fundamental Thing, therefore,
of which water is composed. What is this
Thing? How many such Things are there in
the world? Are there a limitless number, or
only a few? If a certain, limited number, how
many? And how discover them? These were
questions which naturally occupied the minds
of men throughout the ages. No answer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
found, however, and it remained for John Dalton
to discover and formulate the Law which
enabled men to obtain their first glimpse of
the nature of the ultimate constitution of
matter.</p>

in Cumberland (England), and was the
son of a poor weaver. Endowed with natural
aptitude and an indomitable will, he utilized all
possible opportunities for the study of mathematics
and natural philosophy. He taught
school, while devoting all his spare time to
his beloved scientific researches. In fact, he
earned his living as a private teacher to the
end of his life, never having enough money to
pursue his investigations unhampered by material
considerations.</p>

<p>It was, of course, well known that mere <em>mixtures</em>
were entirely different things from chemical
<em>compounds</em>. We can mix sand and sugar
together, but they remain sand and sugar, and
can be separated again, having undergone no
change. Or we can mix together two liquids
or two gases, and they also can again be separated
by suitable means. But when two substances
chemically combine one with another,
then we have some third thing which is entirely
different from the original two, and
which possesses properties dissimilar from
either. Now, what has happened when substances
thus combine? What are the laws of
such combinations? And what are the ultimate
constituents of matter, which render these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
combinations possible? Dalton was the first
to undertake an explanation of these phenomena,
backed up by experimental evidence.
The historic importance of this cannot be
overestimated. As Dr. Raphael Meldola says,
in his <span class="locked">“Chemistry”:—</span></p>

<p>“The doctrine of equivalence, even in its
most elastic form, is still nothing more than
a quantitative expression of the facts of chemical
composition. Of course, there must be
some underlying principle—some explanation
of this simplicity of multiplicity. Such explanation
was first definitely formulated in
1807-08 by John Dalton, who not only discovered
the law of Multiple Proportions, but suggested
a theory, the introduction of which
marks one of the greatest epochs in the history
of Chemistry. The reason why combination
takes place in definite proportions by weight,
and why, when the same element has more
than one equivalent the principle of integral
multiples is maintained is, according to Dalton’s
explanation, because the combination is
between the ultimate particles of which elementary
matter is composed. This is the notion
of the discontinuity or discreteness of
matter. The “particles” of which matter is
composed—whatever its state of aggregation—are,
from Dalton’s point of view, ultimate in
the sense of being indivisible. For this reason
he called them <em>atoms</em>.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ATOMIC_THEORY"><span id="toclink_14"></span>THE ATOMIC THEORY</h2>
</div>

<p>Here, then, we have at last the Atomic
Theory—the theory, that is, that all matter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in all its stages, is built-up of extremely small
particles which are so small, indeed, that they
can no longer be sub-divided. They are the
ultimate of matter—the “building stones of the
Universe”—of which everything, animate and
inanimate, is composed.</p>

<p>These atoms were held to be spherical in
shape, of a certain definite weight and figure,
according to the element or substance in question.
Thus: “every particle of water is like
every other particle of water, every particle of
hydrogen is like every other particle of hydrogen,
etc.” These ultimate particles—atoms—were
held to be indestructible. These atoms
all had their own particular <em>weights</em>, which
might be denoted by number. Hence “atomic
weight.”</p>

<p>These atoms, then, combine, forming molecules,
or compounds of atoms; and molecules
make up matter as we see and know it.</p>

<p>Further, most of the matter in the world
is composed of a variety of elementary substances,
limited in number. When more complex
bodies are analyzed or broken-down, these
elementary substances are always found. The
number of those in Dalton’s day was unknown;
but they had long been known as <em>elements</em>.
Elements were, of course, composed of their
own particular atoms; while all other substances
were made-up of combinations of elements.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ELEMENTS"><span id="toclink_15"></span>THE ELEMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p>Dalton’s views ushered in a new era in
chemistry. Prolonged researches were at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
undertaken, in order to determine the precise
atomic weights—investigations which are being
carried on even today. The exact size,
shape, texture, etc., of the atom was subject to
endless investigation. The nature of chemical
combinations (how two elements combine with
one another) held the fascinated attention of
chemists for a hundred years, and it is only
within the past few years that a definite solution
has been found, and this has only been
rendered possible by the newer views of matter,
entirely different from those maintained
during the past century.</p>

<p>During the hundred years which have
elapsed since Dalton’s time, a number of new
elements have been discovered, and there are
reasons for supposing that there are some yet
to discover. It is now believed, however, that
there are 92 primary elements, of which Hydrogen
has the lowest atomic weight, and Uranium
the highest. Typical elements are: Oxygen,
Iron, Fluorine, Silver, Sodium, Sulphur, Gold,
Zinc, Copper, etc. A complete list may be
found in any standard Chemistry.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ATOMIC_WEIGHTS"><span id="toclink_16"></span>ATOMIC WEIGHTS</h2>
</div>

<p>When work was undertaken, to discover the
exact atomic weights of these various elements,
it was soon found that these could not
be expressed in <em>exact</em>, whole numbers. Fractions
or decimal numbers were nearly always
found to exist. Thus, the atomic weight of
Hydrogen was not exactly 1, but 1.008; copper
was 63.57, etc. For long it was thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
these variations were due to errors of experiment,
and renewed attempts were made to
reach more accurate conclusions, in which these
apparently annoying fractions were absent.
But the most painstaking experimental work
only served to confirm these results, and still
later researches have shown us <em>why</em> this is so.
It would take us too far afield, however, to
go into that question at present.</p>

<p>The various elements were given symbols
for the sake of brevity; some of these represented
the first letters of the name of the
element; some were the first letters of the
Latin word for that element. Thus, Co = Cobalt,
S = Sulphur, Ne = Neon, Bi = Bismuth. On the
other hand, Fe = Iron (Latin, ferrum), etc.
This served greatly to abbreviate chemical
language, and at the same time simplified
chemical formulæ and equations.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VALENCY"><span id="toclink_17"></span>VALENCY</h2>
</div>

<p>We must now explain one or two terms which
are extremely important for understanding
what is to follow. The first of these is <em>Valency</em>.
We know that chemical combinations take
place in fixed proportions by weight; this is
known as the “Constancy of Composition.”
There is always an equivalence noted. This
doctrine of equivalence is merely the numerical
expression of the definiteness of chemical
change. Calculations are made from the point-of-view
of combining with a unit-weight of
hydrogen (the Unit element). In chemical
compounds, then, the doctrine of equivalence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
says that these atomic weights represent quantities
of different elementary substances which
are of the same chemical value as measured by
their capacity for displacing the same weight
of hydrogen.</p>

<p>A new property of the atom is thus brought
out, <abbr>viz.</abbr>, its value as measured by the number
of atoms with which it can combine. This
property is appropriately described as the “Valency”
of the atom. If the atomic weight contains
the equivalent once, <abbr>i.&nbsp;e.</abbr>, if the equivalent
and atomic weight are identical, that atom
can combine only with one atom of hydrogen,
or of chlorine, bromine, etc. The formulæ of
the compounds, HCl, HBr, etc., expresses this
fact. If the equivalent is contained twice in
the atomic weight, then that atom can obviously
combine with two atoms of hydrogen,
chlorine, etc.; if it is contained three times
in the atomic weight, the combining capacity
or valency of the atom is three; and so forth.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PERIODIC_LAW"><span id="toclink_18"></span>THE PERIODIC LAW</h2>
</div>

<p>The work which had been done upon the
atomic weights rendered possible one of the
most brilliant generalizations of modern times,
in this field. This was the <em>Periodic Law</em>. In
the year 1864, Newlands published a Table
containing the various elements arranged in
the order of their atomic weights. In a side
column the differences between these weights
were given, each being deducted from the one
next higher in the scale. The next year, Newlands
announced his “law of octaves,” which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
he deduced from his arrangement of the elements.
He said in part that: “If the elements
are arranged in the order of their equivalents,
with a few slight transpositions ... it will be
observed that elements, belonging to the same
group usually appear on the same horizontal
line.... It will also be seen that the number
of analogous elements generally differ
either by seven or by some multiple of seven;
in other words, members of the same group
stand to each other in the same relation as
the extremities of one or more octaves in music.”</p>

<p>This pioneer work of Newlands rendered possible
the Periodic Law, as finally formulated
and worked out in detail by Mendeleeff. Briefly,
the Law states that “the properties of an element
are a periodic function of its atomic
weight.”</p>

<p>This is merely another way of saying that
if you know the atomic weight of an element,
you also know its properties, since these are
fixed or invariable. Mendeleeff arranged the
elements in various “Groups,” according to
their atomic weights, and it was found that
the properties of the elements periodically recur
as the weights of the atoms rise. There
were certain empty spaces in Mendeleeff’s
Table, waiting for new elements which should
fit into these empty spaces, if discovered. At
the time they had not been discovered; but
several of them have been since, and it is a
remarkable fact that they invariably fit into
his table exhibiting all the properties which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
they should theoretically exhibit, and might
have been predicted to, years before. This is
one of the surest confirmations of the accuracy
of Mendeleeff’s general Law, and is one of the
finest generalizations ever made in science.</p>

<p>The conclusion which we may draw from
this Law is that there is a definite <em>relationship</em>
between the chemical elements. How or why
this relationship existed was not known at the
time, and only became clear half a century
later, when the newer discoveries concerning
the ultimate constitution of matter rendered
this clear.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="EARLIER_DISCOVERIES"><span id="toclink_20"></span>EARLIER DISCOVERIES</h2>
</div>

<p>Mendeleeff’s Law could not have been formulated
had not an immense amount of research
work preceded it, and a number of new elements
been discovered. Such was, however,
the case. Immediately following the great
work of Lavoisier, a host of brilliant chemists
appeared, and rapid and important advances
were made in consequence. Cadmium was discovered
by Stromeyer in 1817; lithium in the
same year by Arfvedson. Silicon was isolated
in 1810 by Berzelius. In 1827, Wohler isolated
aluminum; and the same scientist also isolated
beryllium the following year. Bromine was
discovered by Balard in 1826; iodine, in 1811,
by Courtois. Tellurium had been discovered
by Muller von Reichenstein in 1782; Berzelius
discovered an element closely analogous to it—selenium—in
1817. Elements continued to
be added to the list—and then no more! Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
every element been discovered? Some were
inclined to think so. With the discovery of
Radium, by the Curies, however, another whole
list of elements was brought to light—all of
which have been added to the Table of the
Periodic Law.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, further discoveries of the curious
properties of matter were being made. For
example, it had been noticed that at least three
distinct varieties of sulphur existed: (1) A
pale yellow, brittle solid; (2) translucent
needles; and (3) soft and rubber-like sulphur.
These were all different physical varieties of
one and the same substance—nevertheless they
are all sulphur! This element, then, can assume
more than one form, and because of this,
the term “allotropic” has been applied, to signify
the varieties of appearance which the
same substance can be made to assume. A
good example of this afforded by charcoal,
graphite (or black-lead) and diamond,—which
would hardly be suspected of being all the
same substance; and yet they are!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ANALYSIS_AND_SYNTHESIS"><span id="toclink_21"></span>ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS</h2>
</div>

<p>Compounds may be broken up into their constituents,
during the process of analysis, or
they may be made to combine one with another,
in synthesis. All the resources of modern
science have been brought to bear, in efforts
to effect these various alterations or
changes. Great heat, extreme cold, chemical
reägents, enormous pressures, high vacua, electrical
currents and sparks, bombardment with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
radio-activity, etc.—all have been employed in
these chemical investigations. Suitable laboratories
have been constructed, encasing immense
boilers, huge refrigeration machines,
electrical contrivances of all kinds, etc. What
tremendous strides have been made in this
field during the past century—from the simple
glass retorts, flasks and apparatus of a century
ago! But this only shows us how tremendous
would be our progress could men
but learn to work together, in harmony, welded
together by a common interest,—instead of
butchering one another, or wasting their precious
lives and energies in scandals and political
intrigues!</p>

<p>But let us return to earth again—to matter—the
subject of chemistry!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="FORMULAE_AND_EQUATIONS"><span id="toclink_22"></span>FORMULAE AND EQUATIONS</h2>
</div>

<p>We have seen that the various chemical elements
combine with one another in certain
proportions. In order to express these varied
reactions, chemical formulæ have been devised,
which can be read at a glance, showing the
changes which have taken place in any given
combination. When one atom of one element
combines with one atom of another, the letters
signifying these elements are simply written
side by side, thus: HCl. When, however, two
atoms of one element combine with one of another,
a small figure is placed under and to
the right of the element, thus: H<span class="sub">₂</span>O. Here we
see at a glance that two atoms of hydrogen
have combined with one of oxygen, forming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
water. This is the simplest type of formula,
and is often known as the <em>empirical</em> formula.
There is, however, another way of writing a formula,
which is more expressive, thus:</p>

<pre class="p1 b1 mono center vtight">
     B
A=C=
     B
</pre>

<p class="in0">This is known as a <em>structural</em> or <em>constitutional</em>
formula, and from it we can see at a glance
that A is bivalent, C is quadrivalent, and B
univalent. This type of formula shows us
more readily than the other the structure of
the molecule in question. The complexity of
such formulæ naturally increases with the complexity
of the molecules, and in many cases
may be extremely intricate. Ordinary chemical
formulæ, however, are written empirically.
Any chemical changes which take place as the
result of some reaction are expressed in this
manner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ORGANIC_VS_INORGANIC_CHEMISTRY"><span id="toclink_23"></span>ORGANIC VS. INORGANIC CHEMISTRY</h2>
</div>

<p>As before stated, chemistry has been divided
into two categories—organic and inorganic. It
was stated at the time that these divisions represented
the chemistry of living and dead matter,
respectively. As a matter-of-fact, this description
is not quite accurate. This was the
older view of the observed facts, because it
was believed that some mysterious “vitality”
was responsible for the peculiar substances
found in living bodies, but the chemist has now
succeeded in making, in the laboratory, a number
of these substances which were thought
to be the result of life only; and in addition
has succeeded in making great numbers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
organic compounds not found in the living body.
Over 150,000 “organic” compounds are now
known to the chemist, only a small fraction of
which are known to be the product of “vitality.”
All living things—animal and vegetable—contain
carbon, as their most important constituent,
so that the modern view of organic
chemistry is that it is, very largely, the chemistry
of carbon compounds. Whether or not
any form of “vitality” exists aside from the
living matter studied is a question usually
passed over by chemists as beyond their
province.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that the human
body presents many problems still unexplained
by modern chemistry. Take, for example, the
miracle of digestion. A potato, a cabbage, an
apple, a chicken running about the yard, a
piece of candy—all these are eaten by little
Mary Jones, and are somehow turned into the
body of little Mary Jones, making hair, teeth,
eyes, lungs, liver, nerves, brain, etc. The food
material is somehow transformed into the living
body of the person eating it! Much has
been discovered as to the innumerable changes
which the food undergoes during the various
stages of digestion, but the final result—how
this pabulum is converted into bodily tissue—is
still largely a mystery. We know, for example,
that proteins are broken-up into simpler
compounds, the most important of which
are the amino-acids. Fats are broken up into
fatty acids and glycerine, and substances resembling
soaps are formed in the body. Carbohydrates
are resolved into levulose, glucose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
maltose, etc., which are utilizable by the human
system. But just how these substances
are converted into bodily tissue is still largely
a problem.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ORGANIC_COMPOUNDS"><span id="toclink_25"></span>ORGANIC COMPOUNDS</h2>
</div>

<p>The living matter of the body is composed
of a variety of substances, of which protoplasm
may be taken as typical. This is highly complex,
and while it can be imitated by the chemist,
its living properties have not been reproduced.
(See my book on “Life: Its Origin and
Nature,” in the present series.) The various
secretions and excretions of the body have been
studied exhaustively by physiological chemists.
<em>Plants</em> have also been studied minutely from
a similar point-of-view.</p>

<p>A number of important discoveries have resulted
from this work, however, and nearly all
the essential animal and vegetable substances
are at present accessible to artificial synthesis
from their very elements. Even protein matter
seems to have lost much of its mystery since
we have learned from Emil Fischer’s work that
amino-acids can be combined in the same way
as they occur in protein. Compounds of Amino-acids
can be obtained, which show all the main
reactions of protein substances. Emil Fischer,
of Berlin, was the same chemist who, in 1886,
discovered how to prepare grape-sugar from
glycerine. A considerable number of plant alkaloids
have also been artificially prepared in
the course of the last five or six decades. The
most important coloring matters of plants—for
instance, alizarin and indigotin,—are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
longer extracted from plants for technical purposes,
but are accessible from the products of
coal-tar.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CATALYSIS"><span id="toclink_26"></span>CATALYSIS</h2>
</div>

<p>We now come to a remarkable series of
chemical phenomena, which have been much
studied during the past century, and which
have a bearing upon both organic and inorganic
chemistry. More than a century ago,
it was discovered that certain chemical substances,
which will not normally combine with
one another, can be made to do so, if another
substance is brought into contact with them.
This third substance does not in any way enter
into the combination, or share in the reaction;
its mere presence seems to bring it
about. Thus, oxygen and hydrogen may be
mixed together; but if a small amount of
“platinum black” be introduced, an explosion
of the gases at once occurs. Hydroperoxide is
rapidly split into oxygen and water when in
contact with “platinum black,” etc. These contact-effects
are very curious, and have engaged
the attention of chemists for a long time. Berzelius
is responsible for the term now generally
used—<em>catalysis</em>. We now speak of catalytic
power, catalytic reactions, and so forth.</p>

<p>These catalytic reäctions soon became very
important factors in organic chemistry and biology,
as well as in the field of inorganic chemistry.
In 1833, Payen and Persoz in Paris made
the discovery that germinating seeds contain a
peculiar contact-substance, which transforms
starch into sugar. This substance they named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
<i>Diastase</i>. Similar effects were noted to occur
elsewhere,—particularly in the protein digestion
in the stomach of man and the higher animals.
We now know that many such reäctions
occur in the living cells, and the chemical phenomena
of life have had an entirely new light
thrown upon them by these findings.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ENZYMES"><span id="toclink_27"></span>ENZYMES</h2>
</div>

<p>They led, in short, to the discovery of the
so-called <em>Enzymes</em>. Until relatively recently,
the expression “Ferment” was used, as the phenomena
were akin to fermentation. Soluble ferments
are termed Enzymes, and the phenomena
connected with living protoplasm are now
known to be largely due to the action of a
group of Enzymes. These are catalytic substances,
are of a limited field of action, of colloidal
nature, and very little resistant to heat.
When injected into the veins of animals, other
substances are at once manufactured, which
have been called “anti-enzymes,” which have
the effect of offsetting their action. Sunlight
and ultra-violet light destroy enzymes. Their
importance in the field of biology may be discerned
when it is stated that researches have
shown us that, <abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>, the amount of protein
digested in a certain time is not proportional
to the quantity of the enzyme itself, but to the
square root of the quantity of the enzyme.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="HORMONES"><span id="toclink_27a"></span>HORMONES</h2>
</div>

<p>These enzymes must not be confused with
other internal secretions, such as the <em>hormones</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
These are substances generated by the
so-called ductless glands,—such as the thyroid,
the pituitary, the adrenals, etc. These ductless
glands secrete substances which when absorbed
into the blood-stream greatly affect the life of
the body, its functions, its structure and its
growth, and to a certain extent at least the
mental life. Researches in this field are of
relatively recent origin, but of extreme importance.
I have mentioned this subject at greater
length in my little book on “Life: Its Origin
and Nature,” in the present series, and the
interested reader may refer to such a work as
Dr. Louis Berman’s “The Glands Regulating
Personality,” for further details.</p>

<p>There is no matter anywhere in the universe,
living or dead, which modern chemistry does
not attempt to analyze. Not only in the laboratory
are these tests undertaken, with minute
particles of matter. The very earth on which
we dwell has been subjected to chemical analysis,
and so have the stars, the planets and suns
which circle around us in space,—perhaps
separated from us by many millions of miles.
The ability to do this is assuredly one of the
greatest achievements of the mind of man, and
represents one of the greatest conquests over
nature, over time and space.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEMISTRY_OF_THE_EARTH"><span id="toclink_28"></span>CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH</h2>
</div>

<p>The water constituting our seas, lakes, rivers
and oceans; the air constituting our atmosphere;
the materials of the earth on which
we dwell—clay, rock, mud, granite, metals—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
have been analyzed, and their chemical
composition accurately determined. It has even
been possible to measure the density and weight
of our earth, and to calculate its age, from
the salinity of its oceans. (Of this more anon.)
But when it comes to ascertaining with great
accuracy the chemical constitution of distant
stars, <em>that</em> seems a feat well-nigh impossible,
and unless the process by means of which it
is accomplished were explained, it might very
well be disbelieved.</p>

<p>How, then, can this be accomplished?</p>

<p>For our explanation, we must go back to a
classical experiment made by Sir Isaac Newton.
He proved that white light, when made
to pass through a glass prism, is split up into
a variety of colors. There are seven primary
colors, constituting the visible spectrum. These
are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and
violet. We now know that there are both
“ultra-violet” and “infra-red” rays, invisible to
the eye, above and below the spectrum, but
this was not known until long after. The essential
fact is that light, when passed through
a prism, is split up into its primary colors.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SPECTROSCOPE"><span id="toclink_29"></span>THE SPECTROSCOPE</h2>
</div>

<p>The instruments employed were necessarily
soon refined, and the modern “spectroscope”
resulted,—a piece of apparatus of great delicacy,
capable of studying these effects with
exactitude.</p>

<p>The function of the spectroscope is to receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
a sample of light and to separate its different
components. In a broad sense, everything
that can be seen has a spectrum—flame,
blue sky, red hot metal, the sun, the electric
spark, etc. We can at once divide these things
into two classes, (1) those that are visible because
they emit light of their own; (2) those
that can be seen only by virtue of their reflecting,
diffusing or transmitting light that
falls upon them from other sources. The former
are called “emission spectra” and the latter
“absorption spectra.”</p>

<p>Now, when practically any spectrum be examined
in this way, it will be seen that certain
bands of shadow, or dark lines, cut across
the light spectrum, in absorption spectra, these
are the things which are studied. Thus, when
we observe the spectrum of the sun, or of many
of the stars, we find that the spectrum may
be described as a continuous spectrum, from
which a number of narrow lines are omitted.
The lines consequently appear dark on a bright
ground. These are called “absorption lines.”</p>

<p>Just why these dark lines appear would take
us too far afield to explain here; suffice it to
say that every chemical element has been
found to yield a different spectrum; that is to
say, the number and arrangement of these
dark lines will indicate the presence of the
element in question. Whenever certain lines
appear on the spectrum, we may be sure that
such-and-such an element is present. Thus,
Kirchhoff first proved that two of these dark
lines were caused by the white light of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
solar photosphere having suffered absorption
at the sun, by passing through a stratum of
glowing sodium vapor. Sodium was thus shown
to be present in the sun. Other elements were
similarly identified, not only in the sun, but
in the millions of stars in the heavens. By
means of spectrum analysis, therefore, it has
been possible to detect and identify the various
chemical elements present in any given sun
or star in space.</p>

<p>In this manner, about forty terrestrial elements
have been shown to exist in the sun.
Carbon, oxygen, iron, silicon, nickel, etc., exist
in the sun just as they do on our earth. On
the other hand, many elements, such as mercury,
nitrogen, sulphur, and boron do not appear,
although they are found in abundance on
the earth. Yet several elements were shown
to exist in the sun which up to that time had
not been discovered here. Helium is an example.
(From the Greek, <i>Helios</i>, the Sun).
And yet, when attention was directed to this
element, it was soon found in our earth, and
is today so common that helium gas is employed
to inflate balloons, in preference to
hydrogen, on account of its non-combustibility.</p>

<p>Spectrum analysis, then, tells us the precise
chemical constitution of the various suns, or
stars, in space, and it also tells us that these
stars are incapable of supporting life such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
we know it. As Dr. E. Walter Maunder says,
in his book, “Are the Planets Inhabited?”:</p>

<p>“The application of the spectroscope to astronomy
is not confined to the sun, but reaches
much further. The stars also yield their spectra,
and we are compelled to recognize that they
also are suns; intensely heated globes of glowing
gas, rich in the same elements as those
familiar to us on the Earth and known by their
spectral lines to be present on the sun. The
stars, therefore, cannot themselves be inhabited
worlds any more than the sun, and at a stroke
the whole of the celestial luminaries within the
furthest range of our most powerful telescopes
are removed from our present search (<abbr>i. e.</abbr>,
whether or not life may exist upon them). Only
those members of our solar system that shine
by reflecting the light of the sun can be cool
enough for habitation, the true stars cannot be
inhabited, for, whatever their quality and order,
they are all suns, and must necessarily be in
far too highly heated a condition to be the
abode of life. Many of them may, perhaps, be
a source of light and heat to attendant planets,
but there is no single instance in which such a
planet has been directly observed; no dark, non-luminous
body has ever been actually seen in
attendance on a star. Many double or multiple
stars are known, but these are all instances in
which one sun-like body is revolving round
another of the same order. We see no body
shining by reflected light outside the limits of
the solar system. Planets to the various stars
may exist in countless numbers, but they are
invisible to us....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>Thus has the science of chemistry been
wafted across hundreds of millions of miles of
space, and has enabled us to tell, not only the
composition of these distant bodies, but also
the degree of their habitability, and their possible
sources as abodes of life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INDUSTRIAL_CHEMISTRY"><span id="toclink_33"></span>INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY</h2>
</div>

<p>But if all this is of purely theoretical interest,
the chemistry of our earth and its products is
of immense practical importance. It may be
<em>applied</em>, and the day of “industrial chemistry”
is here. By studying the chemistry of soils, the
farmer has been enabled to increase both the
quality and the quantity of his crops. By employing
artificial fertilizers, production has
been greatly increased. An analysis of the
earth’s strata has thrown great light upon
geology. Analytical chemistry has proved of
service in criminology,—by enabling experts to
detect poisons, blood-stains, etc. (Unfortunately,
it has also been applied detrimentally, in the
manufacture of explosives, poison gases, etc.,
employed in war.) Dentistry and surgery have
been rendered painless by the discovery of
anæsthetics. The wholesale manufacture of
illuminating gas has been instrumental in lighting
millions of homes. The manufacture of
steel, paper, ink, dyes, stains, paints, perfumes,
bread, and a thousand-and-one useful articles of
our daily lives has been rendered possible by
the progress of chemical research. Artificial
preservatives have enabled us to keep food-stuffs
for long periods of time. By the discovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
of the nature of iron rust, bridges, buildings,
etc., have been preserved intact. Our food,
our clothes, our very lives themselves, may be
said to depend upon modern chemistry for
their maintenance and preservation.</p>

<p>Let us pass in rapid summary a few of these
results. Let us take, for example, <em>glass</em>.</p>

<p>Glass is made from silica. What is silica?
It is a substance of remarkable infusibility, and
is the oxide of silicon, which is a near neighbor
of carbon. Glass is made by mixing sand, limestone
and carbonate of soda or potash in large
pots, and melting them together at a temperature
of 3,500° F. The sand, being silica, combines
with the lime of the carbonate of lime,
to give silicate of lime, and with the soda (or
potash) of the carbonate of soda (or potash) to
give silicate or soda (or potash). These two
silicates become intimately fused and form the
glass, which remains liquid in the pot. It is
then blown into various shapes or rolled into
thin sheets for window glass. We know what
an effect windows have had upon the comforts
of modern life!</p>

<p>By mixing together several metals, <em>alloys</em> are
obtained which very often have properties quite
different from those of the substances which
compose them. Thus: Bronze is a mixture of
copper and tin; plumber’s solder is an alloy of
lead and tin; brass is an alloy of copper and
zinc; ferro-silicon is a union of silicon and iron,
etc. Many of these alloys are of great utility in
the various arts and sciences, as well as in
manufacture.</p>

<p>Gilding, silvering and electroplating have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
been rendered possible by modern chemistry.
Alumina and porcelain have been produced.
Alumina is the oxide of aluminum. One variety
of clay known as “kaolin” is employed in the
manufacture of porcelain. China and earthenware
are made by very similar processes.
Alcohol, wine and beer have depended upon
scientific chemistry for their production. Ice
can be manufactured artificially by means of
freezing mixtures. The manufacture of oxygen
gas has rendered possible high altitude flights
by aviators. Camphor can now be manufactured,
instead of depending upon nature’s
resources for this valuable substance. Wood-pulp,
starch and sugar owe much to modern
chemistry. Artificial silk is manufactured on
a large scale. Soaps and fats have likewise
been developed in vast quantities. The perfume
milady uses has been developed by the
chemist. Colors and dyes now constitute an
enormous industry. For our medicines we depend
upon the chemist, when visiting the nearest
drug store. These are but a few examples,
which might be lengthened almost indefinitely,
illustrating the extent to which we are dependent
upon modern chemistry, in our daily
lives.</p>

<p>And chemistry is capable of explaining many
things which would be unintelligible without its
aid. Let us take a simple example by way of
illustration. You have probably noticed that a
frozen potato has a characteristic sugary taste.
The cause of it is this: the potato contains in
its tissues a great quantity of starch, as well as
a diastase capable of transforming this starch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
at the moment of its sprouting. These two substances
are kept apart by the membrane of the
tissue. But if a frost occurs, the ice tears this
membrane, and the starch comes in contact
with this diastase and is, therefore, transformed
into sugar, just as it is when the
sprouting of the potato begins.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INSTRUMENTS_OF_RESEARCH"><span id="toclink_36"></span>INSTRUMENTS OF RESEARCH</h2>
</div>

<p>These applications of chemistry have been
rendered possible by improved methods of investigation,
a greater knowledge of the nature
of matter itself, and the perfection of scientific
instruments of precision. These instruments
are so much finer and more delicate than our
senses that they have been the means of disclosing
the actual constitution of matter. A
man might sit and “meditate” upon the nature
of matter for years, but he would be no nearer
an actual <em>proof</em> as to its constitution than he
was at the beginning. It is generally conceded
that Aristotle possessed one of the finest minds
the world has ever known; yet any school boy
today knows more of the ultimate constitution
of matter than did Aristotle. The reason for
this is that instrumental methods of research
have enabled us to see and measure the ultimate
properties of matter,—which our unaided senses
would never permit us to do. The development
of science in other fields, therefore, has
rendered possible the rapid growth of chemistry,
during the past century; and chemistry,
in turn, has assisted the other sciences. Thus
does all knowledge work hand in hand, when
co-operation is rendered possible!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SALINITY_OF_THE_OCEANS"><span id="toclink_37"></span>SALINITY OF THE OCEANS</h2>
</div>

<p>I referred some time ago to the calculations
which had been made as to the age of the
earth, based upon researches as to the salinity
of the ocean. As we know, the water of all
the oceans is salt water; only that of rivers
and lakes is “fresh.” But the degree of the
ocean’s saltness is not quite constant. It
varies, since evaporation is constantly taking
place; sediments are deposited; and above all
vast quantities of water are being poured into
the ocean by the hundreds of rivers which flow
into it, carrying all kinds of earthy deposits
which have been washed away by their passage
through the river-beds over which they flow.</p>

<p>In 1715, the famous astronomer Edmund Halley
published a paper entitled “A Short Account
of the Saltness of the Ocean.... With a Proposal
by Help Thereof to Discover the Age of
the World.” No definite progress was made,
however, until 1899, when Joly pointed out that
of the many elements which enter into the composition
of salt water, sodium alone tends to
accumulate. All the others are sooner or later
rejected, associating themselves with the detrital
sediments, or forming chemical or organic
sediments by their ultimate precipitation. He
accordingly used sodium as the index of the age
of the oceans. He assumed that the annual
increase of sodium has been more or less constant,
being added to every year by the quantity
washed into the ocean by the rivers. How long
a period of time would it require to reach its
present degree of saltness? Taking all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
oceans as one, the volume of the ocean is approximately
320,000,000 cubic miles. Its density
(according to Murray) is 1.026. On the basis
of these figures, Joly, and after him Sollas and
others, calculated that it would require from
80 to 150 million years for the present degree of
salinity to be reached. Ninety or a hundred
million years would be a fair estimate. Indirectly
therefore, the study of the salinity of
the oceans has thrown light upon the age of
our earth, and its chemical constitution
throughout geological ages.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that chemistry has
not only proved of the utmost practical value
to mankind, but that it has been instrumental
in solving some of the greatest enigmas confronting
the mind of man, and in settling some
philosophical and even theological questions.
(The age of the earth, the composition and
habitability of distant stars, etc.) Attempts
have been made to account for life itself along
purely physico-chemical lines. And all this was
attempted—and in part even rendered possible—before
the ultimate constitution of matter
was known! During the present generation,
an entirely new light has been thrown upon
this central problem, and the ideas of centuries
have been discarded. Let us trace the final
steps of research in this direction, and see
how the latest findings of modern science have
thrown light upon the world-old problem of the
ultimate constitution of matter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RADIO-ACTIVITY"><span id="toclink_39"></span>RADIO-ACTIVITY</h2>
</div>

<p>We saw at the very beginning of this little
book that, from time immemorial, something
corresponding to Atoms were regarded as the
ultimate “building stones” of the universe—tiny
particles, incapable of diversion, beyond
which it was impossible to go. Beginning with
Epicurus and Democritus, this idea took scientific
form; it was held by many philosophers
throughout the ages; it formed the basis of
Dalton’s atomic theory, and was assumed by the
Periodic Law. It was not until the last years
of the preceding century that this idea was
called into question. The discovery of <em>radium</em>,
by the Curies, caused a sensation in the scientific
world. How account for the phenomena
observed? Radium seemed to give off energy
continuously, without losing any; heat was
constantly being radiated without lessening the
original amount. Had the secret of perpetual
motion been discovered? What was happening?
The discovery of other radio-active elements
only tended to increase the problem, instead of
solving it. Here was some new property of
matter, hitherto unsuspected, going on before
the eyes of chemists, which they could not
understand or explain.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRA-ATOMIC_ENERGY"><span id="toclink_39a"></span>INTRA-ATOMIC ENERGY</h2>
</div>

<p>Professor E. Rutherford, of M’Gill University,
Canada, was among the first to propose a new
and startling theory. He said: Suppose that
the atoms are <em>not</em> indivisible? Suppose that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
they are capable of being split-up into something
still smaller and finer? If the atoms
themselves are being disintegrated, immense
quantities of energy would probably be available—“intra-atomic
energy”—which would account
for the results obtained. It is true that
we should no longer have our stable atoms;
they would vanish and be represented by something
else. And that “something” would no
longer be matter, in the sense that we now
understand it; but we could account for the
observed facts (radio-activity, etc.), and we can
then endeavor to discover what atoms are resolved
into later on. This theory was soon
proved to be true; atoms were shown to be
divisible, and capable of being split-up into
something still smaller, which were no longer
“matter” in the old sense. Matter, in short,
had technically disappeared, and had been resolved
into its component parts. This being so,
the question at once arose: Of what is matter
(the atom) composed?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_THEORY_OF_MATTER"><span id="toclink_40"></span>THE THEORY OF MATTER</h2>
</div>

<p>Without going into great detail, or attempting
to trace the history of the various discoveries
which led up to it, it may now be stated
definitely that matter is built-up of <em>electricity</em>.
For the proof of this, the scientific world has
to thank Sir J.&nbsp;J. Thomson, who first popularized
this view in his book “Electricity and Matter.”
He was closely seconded by Sir Oliver
Lodge, Sir William Crookes, and many other
eminent scientists. On this view, matter totally
disappears, as such; it becomes super-sensible;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
it is resolved into energy. Electricity and the
ether somehow are responsible for matter, but
just <em>how</em> was not at the time understood.</p>

<p>It took many years of patient research to
arrive at definite conclusions; in fact, it may
be said that definite conclusions have not even
yet been reached,—though more or less
unanimity of opinion exists as to the structure
of atoms. The new theory of matter is that
each atom is built up of negative “electrons,”
and positive “protons”—the former revolving
round the latter in orbits analogous to those of
our solar system. The protons, positively
charged, remain in the center of the atom; the
electrons, negatively charged, circle about them,
just as our planets circle about the sun. The
number of these protons and electrons varies
according to the nature of the element. Hydrogen
representing unity, has but one electron revolving
around a single proton; helium comes
next, with two; and so on, up the scale, until
we reach uranium, which has ninety-two. The
positive and the negative charges balance one
another in all stable atoms; and when this is
not the case, the atom tends to go to pieces
or disintegrate; electrons are shot off, which
join some other atom, and radio-activity results.
The nature of the element itself is accordingly
changed, and may even be so fundamentally
changed by this process that it turns into something
else; <abbr>i. e.</abbr>, the transmutation of one element
into another has taken place, as dreamed
of by the alchemists! Hence we often hear of
the “new alchemy.” This, in rough outline, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the modern conception of the atom, and of the
constitution of matter generally.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="WITHIN_THE_ATOM"><span id="toclink_42"></span>WITHIN THE ATOM</h2>
</div>

<p>Let us now endeavor to analyze the atom
more closely, in the light of these newer researches.
We have seen that the electrons revolve
round the central protons. These protons
are probably composed of electrons and hydrogen
nuclei. The total central “sun”—to use the
astronomical analogy—is known as the nucleus.
The relative sizes of these bodies may be appreciated
when it is stated that they have been
compared to the sizes of the planets, relative
to the distances separating them from the sun.
Vast spaces exist, therefore, within the atom,
in which the electrons revolve. Yet the atoms
themselves are inconceivably small! The following
quotation from Bertrand Russell’s “A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C.
of Atoms” will perhaps make this clear.
He says:</p>

<p>“It will help us to picture the world of atoms
if we have, to begin with, some idea of the size
of these units. Let us begin with a gramme of
hydrogen (1/453 of a pound), which is not a
very large quantity. How many atoms will
it contain? If the atoms were made up into
bundles of a million-million, and then into a
million-million of these bundles, we should have
about a gramme and a half of hydrogen. That
is to say, the weight of one atom of hydrogen is
about a million-millionth of a million-millionth
of a gramme and a half. Other atoms weigh
more than the atom of hydrogen, but not
enormously more; an atom of oxygen weighs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
sixteen times as much, an atom of lead rather
more than 200 times as much. <i lang="la">Per contra</i>, an
electron weighs very much less than a hydrogen
atom; it takes about 1,850 electrons to
weigh as much as one hydrogen atom.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ELECTRONS"><span id="toclink_43"></span>ELECTRONS</h2>
</div>

<p>The inner rings of electrons give rise to X-rays
when they are disturbed, and it is chiefly
by means of X-rays that their constitution is
studied. The nucleus itself is the source of
radio-activity.... The most complex atom
known is that of uranium, which has, in its
normal state, 92 electrons revolving round the
nucleus, while the nucleus itself probably consists
of 238 hydrogen nuclei and 146 electrons....</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, when the hydrogen
atom is unelectrified, the electron simply continues
to go round and round the nucleus, just
as the earth continues to go round and round
the sun. The electron may move in any one of
a certain set of orbits, some larger, some smaller,
some circular, some elliptical. But when the
atom is undisturbed, it has a preference for
the smallest of the circular orbits, in which
the distance between the nucleus and the electron
is about half a hundred-millionth of a
centimetre. It goes round in this tiny orbit
with very great rapidity; in fact its velocity is
about a hundred-and-thirty-fourth of the velocity
of light, which is 186,000 miles a second.
Thus the electron manages to cover about 1,400
miles in every second. To do this, it has to go
round its tiny orbit about seven thousand million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
times in a millionth of a second; that is
to say, in a millionth of a second it has to
live through about seven thousand million of
its “years”!</p>

<p>Such figures, such facts, stagger the imagination.
The mind of man cannot really conceive
them. And yet we know that they are not
fanciful; calculations and indirect measurements
have been made with the utmost exactitude.
And, after all, the infinitely little is no
more staggering than the infinitely great. For
in astronomy we know that stars billions of
miles distant from us in space have been seen,
measured, photographed and analyzed. Tens of
thousands of “light-years” separate us from
them (<abbr>i. e.</abbr>, space which would be travelled by
light, speeding at 186,000 miles a second). And
yet the structure of the atom closely resembles
the planetary system! Is the whole Universe,
great and small, built according to the same
plan, according to the same model? It would
appear so!</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that the modern
science of chemistry overlaps other sciences
in many directions—physics, biology, astronomy,
etc. These sciences are to a certain
extent now inter-woven and inter-blended.
Where the one ends and the other begins it is
hard to say. Again we see the importance of co-operation
in these various fields of inquiry!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NATURE_OF_MATTER"><span id="toclink_44"></span>THE NATURE OF MATTER</h2>

<p>These newer researches in chemistry have
finally enabled us to realize the ultimate constitution
of matter; we have seen that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
composed of atoms, but these atoms themselves
are complex things; they in turn are composed
of electrons, and in the last analysis matter
may be said to be non-existent! It has been
resolved into electricity. But this conception of
matter has also enabled us to explain many
things before inexplicable—chemical combination,
radio-activity, and what not. The world-old
problem as to the nature of matter has at
last been solved. It now devolves upon the
physicist to explain the ultimate nature of
electricity!</p>

<p>Matter, then, in a sense, can dissociate, disintegrate,
dematerialize. It can also integrate,
materialize, come into existence. Matter can
be made to vanish and reappear. The old law
of the “indestructibility of matter” is not valid,
as generally understood. Matter can be resolved
into energy. And this energy is radiated into
space, or converted into other modes of energy,
and finally into heat, which is in turn radiated
into the surrounding medium. The whole
universe seems to resemble a clock, which has
been wound-up, and is slowly running down.
Even the law of the “conservation of energy”
has been called into question (See LeBon, “The
Evolution of Matter,” and “The Evolution of
Forces”). Is the whole Universe in some mysterious
manner also being wound-up? Or does
it move in vast cycles, of alternate action and
inaction, as the Hindu philosophers have always
contended? These are ultimate questions
which only the science of the future can solve!</p>

<p>We have now made a rapid survey of the

newer conceptions of the constitution of matter.
We must now say a few words as to the
nature of the various elements themselves, and
give a brief account of some modern researches.
A few practical hints as to experiments may
also be of interest to the reader.</p>

<p>We have seen that when two chemical elements
combine, some third substance is formed,
quite different in properties from the original
two. Thus, water seems to us entirely different
from the two invisible gases which compose it—oxygen
and hydrogen. Yet a simple experiment
will prove that such is the case. We
can decompose water by means of an electric
current, when the original gases are given off,
in the proportion of two to one—hydrogen collecting
at the negative pole, and oxygen at the
positive. This process can be kept up until all
the water has been decomposed, and only hydrogen
and oxygen gases remain. This process
of electrical decomposition is known as <em>electrolysis</em>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ELEMENTS2"><span id="toclink_46"></span>THE ELEMENTS</h2>

<p><em>Hydrogen</em> is the lightest of all gases, and, as
we have seen, the simplest of the elements, in
its constitution. Like all gases, it can be liquefied,
and even frozen solid into a hard lump,
like ice. On the other hand, even the densest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of substances can be liquefied, and even turned
into gas or vapor at a sufficiently high temperature.
(Gases are rendered liquid or solid
at a very low temperature.) Liquid air, for
example, is so cold that when a can of it is
set upon a block of ice the liquid air boils and
gives off “steam”!</p>

<p><em>Oxygen</em> gas constitutes about one-fifth of our
atmospheric air (the other four parts being
nitrogen) and is the most essential element in
supporting life. Without it, life would at once
become extinct. All forms of combustion take
place very rapidly in oxygen, and the combustion
going on within the human body is no exception
to this rule. The atmospheric nitrogen
acts as a sort of dilutant, being an inert gas.
If a mouse be placed under a jar of pure oxygen
gas, it will often run round and round until
it drops dead with exhaustion. In an atmosphere
of pure oxygen, we should soon burn up,
and live our lives too rapidly.</p>

<p>Oxygen has a great tendency to combine with
various other elements, particularly metals.
Thus, iron rust is due to the combination of
oxygen with iron; the blackening and tarnishing
of cooking pots is due to the slow oxidation
of copper, etc.</p>

<p>In breathing, we take in oxygen from the
air, which combines with the gases in the
lungs, forming carbon dioxide. Curiously
enough, plants thrive upon this gas, which is
so poisonous to human beings, and in turn give
off oxygen. Hence the value of plants and
flowers in the room, or in any densely inhabited
area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p><em>Nitrogen</em> is a very important element, entering
into many chemical combinations. It forms
the basis of explosives, used in war. Until relatively
recently, this element had to be obtained
from substances dug out of the ground, but
during the late war, methods were devised for
obtaining it from the air. “Nitrogen fixation”
became possible. If it had not been for this
discovery, Germany would have had to give up
the war in 1916, at the latest.</p>

<p>Nitrogen combines with hydrogen, to form
ammonia; with oxygen and water, to form
nitric acid; with nitric acid and potash to form
gunpowder, etc.</p>

<p>Certain oxides combine with water, to form
what are known as <em>bases</em>. Bases can combine
with acids, giving rise to <em>salts</em>.</p>

<p><em>Carbon</em> is an essential element for all living
matter; it combines with oxygen, to yield carbonic
acid; with hydrogen, giving rise to a
great number of compounds, such as benzene,
turpentine, etc. Marsh gas, illuminating gas,
acetylene, etc., are compounds of carbon.</p>

<p><em>Chlorine</em> is a very important element, combining
with sodium to form common salt. As
we have seen, the saltness of the sea is due to
this substance. Owing to its great affinity for
hydrogen, chlorine decomposes water, setting
free oxygen. The result of this is that a mixture
of chlorine and water has strong bleaching
qualities.</p>

<p>Chlorine also combines with hydrogen to
form hydrochloric acid. On the other hand, it
shows little sympathy for oxygen, forming but
few stable compounds. Chloroform, so long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
useful in surgical anaesthesia, is a compound
of chlorine, carbon and hydrogen.</p>

<p><em>Sulphur</em> can assume a variety of appearances
(allotrophic variation) as we have seen. Sulphuric
acid, etc., are its compounds. The latter
substance is used for bleaching violets, but the
flowers become violet again when put into an
ammonia solution.</p>

<p><em>Sodium</em> is a metal, which burns when thrown
into water. It is the other constituent of common
salt, and enters into a great variety of
combinations. Carbonate of soda is one of
these.</p>

<p>Many of the elements—iron, nickel, gold,
platinum, silver, etc.,—are too well known to
necessitate more than a brief note. It is interesting
to notice, however, that there are certain
“family relations” among a number of the
elements. Thus, sodium and potassium are “related”;
and so are barium, strontium and calcium.
Again, oxygen and sulphur have a number
of points in common,—although one is a
solid and the other a gas! Gold stands rather
apart from the rest.</p>

<p>Two very interesting groups should be mentioned
in this place. The first is the group of
<em>rare gases</em>—argon, neon, etc.,—most of which
have been discovered only recently. They are
inert, and partly on account of this, and partly
on account of their rarity, their discovery
was so long delayed.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="RADIO-ACTIVITY2"><span id="toclink_49"></span>RADIO-ACTIVITY</h2>
</div>

<p>The second list is the <em>radio-active</em> group of
elements,—uranium, radium, thorium, actinium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
etc. These all possess their characteristic properties
in varying degrees,—giving off alpha,
beta and gamma rays. A certain mysterious
“emanation” is also emitted by radio-active elements,
but the study of these rays and their
influence would take us into the realm of “physics,”
and would more properly belong to a book
on physics than in the present, dealing with
chemistry.</p>

<p>One very interesting fact should, however, be
mentioned in this connection, and that is the
evolution of matter which has been observed,
as the result of spectrum analysis. We have
heard much of organic evolution, meaning the
evolution of life upon our planet. It is equally
true that there is an inorganic evolution, in
which the gradual development of chemical elements
may similarly be traced. Thus, it has
been noticed that, in the hottest stars, (gaseous)
the fewest chemical elements exist; in
those of medium temperature (metallic), more
elements are found, while in those having the
lowest temperature (carbon stars) the greatest
number of chemical elements are to be distinguished.
This seems to prove that the higher
the temperature, the fewer the elements, which
in turn leads to the conclusion that all elements
are perhaps ultimately ONE—as Sir
William Crookes suggested many years ago. As
these stars cool, more and more elements seem
to be “crystallized out,” so to say,—the many
being formed from the fewer. The newer researches
on the constitution of matter render
this idea all the more plausible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ORIGIN_OF_LIFE"><span id="toclink_51"></span>THE ORIGIN OF LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p>Just here, it might be well to point out the
late place occupied by life, in this process of
inorganic evolution. The Absolute Zero of inter-stellar
space is about -273°C. On the other
hand, the temperature of the hottest stars is
more than 30,000°! (Argo, Alnitam, etc.) The
temperature must fall from this to a few degrees
above Zero (the boiling point of water),
before life can become manifest at all. Life as
we know it can only exist between the boiling
and the freezing points of water. This point is
only reached towards the very end of the scale.
It has therefore been said that, cosmically
speaking, life is only a “flash in the pan between
two eternities”—but for us that flash in
the pan is everything!</p>

<p>The question of the origin of life upon our
planet has been discussed at some length in my
little book on “Life: Its Origin and Nature,” in
the present series. It may be of interest to
mention here, however, a few of the experiments
which have been made upon the artificial
creation of life, by means of inorganic
chemicals, since these properly fall into place
in a book devoted to chemistry.</p>

<p>Dr. H. Charlton Bastian, of England, conducted
many years ago a series of experiments of
this character, in which he claimed to have
made living matter from sterilized chemicals.
He placed these in a glass bottle which had
been sterilized, heated the contents until steam
issued from the mouth of the flask, and then
instantly sealed up the bottle, preventing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
entrance of air. The flasks were then put away
for several days, and at the end of that time
were found, upon examination, to contain living
organisms.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CREATION_OF_LIFE"><span id="toclink_52"></span>“CREATION” OF LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p>The reader will probably be interested in
knowing the precise chemical formulæ employed
for obtaining these astonishing results. Several
such formulæ are given in Dr. Bastian’s book,
“The Evolution of Life,” of which the following
are samples:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Sodium silicate, two, or three, drops.</li>
<li>Ammonium phosphate, four, or six, grains.</li>
<li>Dilute phosphoric acid, four, or six, drops.</li>
<li>Distilled water, one fluid ounce.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Another formula is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Sodium silicate, three drops.</li>
<li>Liquor ferri pernitratis, eight drops.</li>
<li>Distilled water, one fluid ounce.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The reader can try the experiment for himself.
It should be said, however, that although
Dr. Bastian’s results were undoubted, they
failed to carry conviction to the scientific world
as a whole, since they contended that some experimental
error must have crept in, to render
these results possible; and it is significant, in
this connection, that the same experiments repeated
by other men failed to yield the same
striking results.</p>

<p>Chemistry, then, enters into practically every
field of inquiry—the constitution of human beings,
no less than that of metals, earths or distant
nebulæ. Everything material in the Universe
is composed of elements, of atoms, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
these atoms are built-up, as we have seen, of
electrons, which are not matter at all, but bundles
of energy. No two particles of matter in
the world actually touch, or come near to touching
one another. It is an interesting thought,
when one stops to think of it that, for instance,
the steel pillar supporting a “sky-scraper,” upon
which rests an enormous weight (the whole of
the superstructure) is not really dense and
solid, as it appears, but is actually tenuous and
shadowy, and that no two of its atoms ever
touch one another; they are separated by relatively
vast spaces, filled only with the hypothetical
“ether.” The whole weight of the
building may be said to rest upon nothing,—or
at most upon ether, which thus bears its
strain!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ETHER"><span id="toclink_53"></span>THE ETHER</h2>
</div>

<p>And what is this ether? Is it matter in some
subtle form, or is it something else? We do
not know; certainly it is no form of matter
known to us, and its reality has even been
called into question of late. Hæckel, as we
know, contended (“The Riddle of the Universe”)
that the ether must be like some extremely
attenuated jelly, and that a sphere of
it the size of the earth would probably weigh
about 250 pounds! Such crude conceptions have
long since been given up. It is far more subtle
than this. Is it analogous to the finest gas?
Some have thought so; and yet Sir Oliver
Lodge, one of the greatest authorities upon
the ether, has contended that it is more dense
and solid than platinum or gold, and that matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
represents mere “bubbles” within this dense
medium, capable of moving freely through it.
In support of this view, he has cited (in his
“Ether of Space”) the enormous gravitational
pull of the earth upon the moon, <abbr>e.&nbsp;g.</abbr>, or of
the sun upon the earth. The mass of the earth
is approximately 6,000 trillion tons; that of the
moon one-eightieth of this. From these data,
the gravitational pull of the earth upon the
moon can be calculated; and, regarding this,
Sir Oliver says:</p>

<p>“A pillar of steel which could transmit this
force, provided it could sustain a tension of 40
tons to the square inch, would have a diameter
of about 400 miles.... If this force were to
be transmitted by a forest of weightless pillars,
each a square foot in cross section, with a tension
of 30 tons to the square inch throughout,
there would have to be 5 million million of
them.”</p>

<p>Calculating the gravitational pull of the sun
on the earth, in a similar manner, it was calculated
that the strain in this case would have
to be borne by “a million million round rods or
pillars each thirty feet in diameter.”</p>

<p>It may readily be seen, then, from these figures,
that something enormously dense, apparently,
must exist in order to bear this strain,
and this must be the ether. And yet no physical
experiments have proved to us the existence of
the ether; we only infer its presence, and say
that it <em>must</em> exist, in order to account for certain
phenomena observed in physics. It was, I
think, Lord Kelvin who remarked that no man
could believe in the ether without at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
time believing it to possess opposite and contradictory
properties! Indeed, it would seem
so!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEMISTRY_AND_META-PHYSICS"><span id="toclink_55"></span>CHEMISTRY AND META-PHYSICS</h2>
</div>

<p>Such speculations as these lead us far afield,
into the realm of mathematics, metaphysics and
ultimate realities. Even the most material of
all the sciences—chemistry—leads thither when
pushed to its final analysis. The visible, sensible
universe vanishes, and is replaced by the
invisible, the super-sensible. Yet science has
been our guide throughout. William James once
remarked that metaphysics is merely “persistently
clear thinking.” It endeavors to find the
ultimate causes of things, the <em>noumena</em> behind
phenomena, the reality behind appearances.
The physical world in which we live is a world
of phenomena only; real in a sense, and for all
practical purposes, and yet the greatest of all
unrealities in another sense. It is a mere world
of appearances; a phantasmagoria of fleeting
shapes and shadows. We feel that reality must
exist somehow, somewhere; yet we can never
find it. We can no more find it by chemical
analysis than we can discover the mind and
soul of man by dissecting the brains of corpses,—or
even by vivisection! Something always
escapes us—the Soul of Things, the Ultimate
Reality, the Great Unknown.</p>

<p>Such thoughts and speculations as these,
however, need not occupy the mind of the practical
chemist. For him, atoms exist, so do elements,
so does “matter.” For practical, daily
life, we certainly have to live <em>as if</em> matter existed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
and the chemist has to proceed with his
work upon the assumption that matter actually
does exist—it is “real.” Certain it is that the
practical furtherance and application of this
science can come about in no other way. Chemistry
has revolutionized our lives; it has penetrated
all fields of commerce and industry, and
its practical application has rendered possible
and pleasant the lives of countless thousands
of persons now living upon our planet. We
owe more to chemistry than we can ever repay—or
rather to those brilliant and unselfish men
who have built up the modern science of chemistry.
It is my hope that the present little book
may in some degree have helped to emphasize
this fact.</p>
